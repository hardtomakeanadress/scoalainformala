            <h3>Hearing Aids & Dentures</h3>
            <p>
              A hearing aid is a device designed to improve hearing. Hearing aids are classified as medical devices in most countries,
               and regulated by the respective regulations. Small audio amplifiers such as PSAPs or other plain sound reinforcing systems cannot be sold as "hearing aids".

            <h3>Laptops & Tablets</h3>
            <p>
              A laptop, often called a notebook or "notebook computer", is a small, portable personal computer with a "clamshell" form factor,
              an alphanumeric keyboard on the lower part of the "clamshell" and a thin LCD or LED computer screen on the upper part, which is opened up to use the computer.

              Glasses, also known as eyeglasses or spectacles,
              are devices consisting of glass or hard plastic lenses mounted in a frame that holds them in front of a person's eyes,
              typically using a bridge over the nose and arms which rest over the ears.

            <h3>Clothing</h3>
            <p>
              Physically, clothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the elements, and can enhance safety during hazardous activities such as hiking and cooking.
               It protects the wearer from rough surfaces, rash-causing plants, insect bites, splinters, thorns and prickles by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment.
